There are 4 .ipynb files in total:

Companies.ipynb: Contains code of an LSTM model that we ran on all different companies by just changing the name of the company(at the start of code) and we will be getting the comparison for the original value and LSTM predicted value for all the companies respectively. 
Models.ipynb: contains code for comparing three different models LSTM, GRU and SimpleRNN on Oracle stock dataset as reference.
Prices.ipynb: contains code for taking into account different input parameters such as  closing, opening, high, mean values of stock.
Time_Step_Values.ipynb:  we varied the values of timestep and calculated the test data error and traindata error , also we plotted the graph to get a visual idea of changes.


For all the files(.ipynb) we can open it on any IDE(we used Google Colab) and run it by pressing Ctrl+F9(in Colab) or simply by clicking on Run All cells on other IDE's.
